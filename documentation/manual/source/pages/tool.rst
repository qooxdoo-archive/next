Tooling
*********

qooxdoo's tool chain comes with the SDK and comprises tools that help you
create and maintain your %{JS} applications. They fall into two broad
categories:

* command-line tools
* browser-based tools

Command-line tools are tools that run on your operating system's command shell,
like *bash* for MacOSX and Linux, or *cmd* or *PowerShell* for Microsoft
Windows. They generally require a Python installation on your system. Two
important examples of this category are *create-application.py*, sort of an
application wizard which you use to create a new application, and *generate.py*
which you use during your development activities (and referred to as the
"generator"), e.g. to build a running application from your source code.

Browser-based tools run in a web browser. Among them are the Apiviewer, which
provides an interactive API reference, the Testrunner, which allows running
your unit test in a GUI, or the Inspector, which allows to inspect the visual
elements of your application and manipulate their properties.

As the browser-based applications are mostly described elsewhere, this section
deals mainly with the command-line tools. It also provides a general
introduction into the qooxdoo SDK and its structure.
